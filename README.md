# Persistapp

## Overview

This application serves as a Proof of Concept (PoC) to showcase the usage of IndexedDB in a Svelte application.
The primary goal is to demonstrate how IndexedDB can be seamlessly integrated into a Svelte project and how the Svelte Store can be utilized to make data persistence efficient and straightforward.

## Features

1. **IndexedDB Integration**: Explore the power of IndexedDB, a low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data.

2. **Svelte Store Usage**: Witness the synergy between IndexedDB and Svelte Store to create a smooth and persistent data management system.

3. **Data Persistence**: Learn how to store and retrieve data persistently across sessions, providing a seamless user experience.
